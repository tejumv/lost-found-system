## 🔍 Why "No Recent Activity"?

If you see "No recent activity to display", it's because:

1. **No activities in database yet** - Activities are logged when:
   - Users register
   - Items are posted/updated
   - Admin performs actions
   - Items are claimed/resolved

2. **Solution**: As users interact with the system, activities will automatically appear!

---

## ✅ What Works Now:

### **Dashboard:**
✅ Shows real statistics  
✅ Recent activity feed (when data exists)  
✅ Click stat cards to filter items  

### **Analytics:**
✅ System overview with stats  
✅ Visual progress charts  
✅ Recent activity (up to 20 items)  
✅ Key metrics dashboard  
✅ Refresh functionality  

### **Reports:**

✅ Refresh functionality
